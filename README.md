## About the project
ScratchCourse is an interactive learning platform built upon the original Scratch-GUI (https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-gui), designed to make programming education more engaging. The project adds unique features, including a progress map and pop-up windows that guide users through exercises, explain tasks, and verify solutions in real-time.

## Features
* Interactive Map: visual progression map where users can select tasks and track their learning journey.
* Guided Exercises: pop-up windows provide detailed instructions for each task, ensuring learners stay on track.
* Automated Solution Checking: after completing tasks, users receive immediate feedback on their solutions.
* Account Management: users can create and manage accounts to save progress, personalize their experience, and resume tasks at any time.

This project aims to enhance the Scratch learning experience, making it more intuitive and supportive for both beginners and educators.
